    </p>
        <h3>Diane went to Mexico</h3>
            <p>"I was so nervous to travel. I've never been outside of the country before, and everything about it was so scary! Budget Vacations made everything so simple! They even helped me when I ran into issues at the airport on their customer service line. I loved Mexico, my husband has been wanting to take me for years, and Budget Vacations made that possible!"</p>
        <h3>Perry loved Idaho</h3>
            <p>"I've had my fair share of travel in my day, being a veteran, but never has it been so easy! Budget Vacations brought me from crowded New York to the beautiful nature of Idaho smoothly and quickly. It was a last-minute trip, but Budget Vacations made it all possible."</p>
        <h3>Wesley saw Japan for the first time</h3>
            <p>"I've have always wanted to visit my mother's birthplace, but it was always too expensive and stressful to plan a trip. I heard about Budget Vacations from a friend and knew I had to try it out. I'm so glad I did! Budget Vacations helped me to visit special places with my mother and we didn't have the stress of an expensive cost!"</p>
        <h3>Annie fell in love with Germany</h3>
            <p>"I took a 3-month trip to Germany to finish writing my novel. Going in, I thought it was going to cost an arm and a leg. But then I found Budget Vacations and realized that I didn't have to spend all my savings to get to Germany for this novel! The Travel Agent, Linda, helped me find affordable housing and transportation. I am so thankful for the team at Budget Vacations!"</p><br>
