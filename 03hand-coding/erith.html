            <a href="explore.html">Back to Map</a>
            <dl>
                <dt>Ruling God:</dt>
                <dd>Erith, God of the Flowing Water.</dd>
                <dt>People's Name:</dt>
                <dd>Erith Kin</dd>
                <dt>Average Life Span:</dt>
                <dd>250-275 years</dd>
                <dt>Age of Adulthood:</dt>
                <dd>27 years</dd>
                <dt>Gestation Period Length:</dt>
                <dd>15 months</dd>
                <dt>Average Adult Height:</dt>
                <dd>2.34 m</dd>
                <dt>Genders:</dt>
                <dd>Boy and Girl</dd>
                <dt>Reproduction Process:</dt>
                <dd>Normal mammalian reproduction. Birth children one to two at a time.</dd>
                <dt>Gifts from Gods:</dt>
                <dd>Erith himself views the gift of being the only children of a god to live fully underwater as a gift in and of itself. Erith kin have a whole world within a wrold that is all theirs. However, when one has practiced and studied enough, called an Erimage, they can call upton the creative powers of Erith to perform complicated spells and rituals. </dd>
                <dt>Habitat:</dt>
                <dd>Erith kin live under the water. They built one city completely above water to prove to their rivals, the Ishumen, that they could.</dd>
                <dt>Physical Attriutes:</dt>
                <dd>Erith kin white irredescent skin. They are very long and tall. They have webbed toes and fingers. They keep their fingers and toes close together when they are out of the water to prevent the webbing from drying out. They have no nose, in its place is a slight bump that they can use for echo location. They don't have protruding ears either, just holes on either side of the head. They have gills on their lower ribcage/upper abdomen. These can also be used for breathing above water, however, if doing it for an extended period of time, they need to be covered with a loli leaf to prevent the gills from drying out. When on land, Erith kin wear large parkas and very wide brimmed hats and lots of protective clothing to shield them from the sun and dry wind.</dd>
                <dt>Life style and Culture:</dt>
                <dd>Erith kin live life completely under water if they can. Only soldiers and ambassadors go on land. The Erith kin see themselves as superior to the Ishumen. But they are secretly jealous of some aspects of life on land. They think they should be the dominating world power, but the Ishumen disagree since they cannot live entirely on land, where the Ishumen live. Erith kin are very integrated into their environment underwater. They ride on water beasts, farm water crops and animals, and live in natural outcroppings underwater. They are very technilogically advanced, however, as proven by their city above water. Many of their advancements come about because of the Erimages' spells and power.</dd>
                <dt>Government:</dt>
                <dd>Ruled by the Council of the Royal Family and the Council of the Erimage.</dd>
