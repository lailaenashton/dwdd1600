            <p>Ever since Laila Ashton was a child, she has been <strong>creating</strong>. From creating her own baking recipes to making a doll-sized Hogwarts on her bedroom floor to daydreaming of magical stories while on family hikes. She loved learning new things because new knowledge allowed her to create even more. While in high school, Ashton found a love for the sciences. She took as many science classes as she could and attended science conferences and museums. <br>
            In college, Ashton started off as a Biology major at Utah Valley University. However, her creative side and constant daydreaming eventually got the better of her. The initial idea for The Chronicles of Ithmanu came to Ashton in a dream. Ultimately, this dream <i>changed the trajectory</i> of her life. <br>
            Laila Ashton eventually decided to marry her love of STEM and of creativity in her career as a Science-fiction/fantasy author. She loves it and has never regretted this decision.<br>
            In her free time, Ashton also loves painting and biking. She lives with her husband and dog in Utah. She is still going to school at UVU, but on a much different path than before. She is now studying Graphic Design to supplement her book writing career and to keep her creative juices working. <br>
            Laila Ashton is also the author of <a href="https://lailaenashton.wixsite.com/my-site-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >LENA's Hashi Recipes</a>.
