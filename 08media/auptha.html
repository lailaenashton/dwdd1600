                <dt>Reproduction Process:</dt>
                <dd>Normal mammalian reproduction. Birth children one at a time.</dd>
                <dt>Gifts from Gods:</dt>
                <dd>Powerful telekinesis. It is said that they "control gravity."</dd>
                <dt>Habitat:</dt>
                <dd>High in the tops of the northern mountains. They love living in the clear air where they can be as close to the stars as possible. </dd>
                <dt>Physical Attriutes:</dt>
                <dd>They are often described as the most beautiful people to ever walk on Ithmanu. They have olive skin and silvery blue hair. When they were first created, they had eyes like colored jewels and long, slender, pointed ears. When Auptha cast them into their heavenly prisons, She cursed them to always watch the world they had been banished from. This curse had two side effects. Their ears grew to be huge and wide, so they could always hear Ithmanu. Their eyes were cursed to be able to see great distances, to always see Ithmanu. Because of this, they cannot see well up close.</dd>
                <dt>Life style and Culture:</dt>
                <dd>The Aupthalans built large palaces and temples for themselves and for their Goddess Auptha. They spent their days eating the finest foods, dressed in the finest clothes, and partaking in the best entertainment and literature that the creatures of Ithmanu had to offer. Their idea of adventure was to graciously offer their amazing abilities as service to their follow inhabitants of Ithmanu. But the Aupthalans began to see themselves as superior to all other creations because of their role as mediators between the other species. They started charging heavy prices on their ability to "bring peace" and soon many tribes and peoples were indebted to them. They started to accept slavery as a form of payment.</dd>
                <dt>Government:</dt>
                <dd>The Aupthalans are ruled by their queen. All Aupthalans are viewed as royalty when compared to other species on Ithmanu. But even within their own ranks there is a strict heirarchy. The royal family is often the most powerful in their telekinesis magic. They pass the crown in a matriarchal fashion because the strength of telekinesis is passed down from mother to offspring. </dd>
