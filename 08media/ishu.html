                <dt>Ruling God:</dt>
                <dd>Ishu, God of the Rich Soil</dd>
                <dt>People's Name:</dt>
                <dd>Ishumen and Ishuwomen</dd>
                <dt>Average Life Span:</dt>
                <dd>100-110 years</dd>
                <dt>Age of Adulthood:</dt>
                <dd>19 years</dd>
                <dt>Gestation Period Length:</dt>
                <dd>10 months</dd>
                <dt>Average Adult Height:</dt>
                <dd>1.65 m</dd>
                <dt>Genders:</dt>
                <dd>Boy and Girl</dd>
                <dt>Reproduction Process:</dt>
                <dd>Normal mammalian reproduction. Birth children one at a time.</dd>
                <dt>Gifts from Gods:</dt>
                <dd>Ishumen can communicate with animals and plants. It is a gift that has to be cultivated and practiced by each individual for each individual plant and animal species. In modern times, many Ishumen see it as pointless to cultivate this gift and therefore never do. In modern ages, Ishumen rely on technology.</dd>
                <dt>Habitat:</dt>
                <dd>Meadows and forested hills at the base of The Great Northern Mountains.</dd>
                <dt>Physical Attriutes:</dt>
                <dd>Ishumen have dark skin and wavy earth toned hair. They have either deer or ox horns protruding from their skulls, usually one from each side of the forehead. Generally Ishumen have one type of horn or the other, not a mix of the two. Ishumen have larger feet and hands relative to their body size. They have hairy arms, legs, and bodies. They have cat-like fuzzy ears. </dd>
                <dt>Life style and Culture:</dt>
                <dd>A technilogically advanced society, but without any of the gleam and shine that futuristic societies are portrayed as. Ishumen rely on combustion engines for their motor bikes, hover crafts, and ships. They have heating and cooling systems for upper class homes and government buildings. Their habitat has long winters and flooding of the lower plains in the summers. They rely also on hydroponic green houses, labored by the lower class, for their year round food source. At the end of every summer, the Plains Temple is revealed as the floods recede. There is a Harvest Festival and Ceremony every year at this temple. Traditionally, Isumen with connections to lightning bugs and other glowing critters brought them to light the festival and remind the people of their connection with the planet, the God Ithmanu and the God Ishu. In modern times, it has become much more of a concert party with artificial lighting and defecation of the historic religious monutments.</dd>
                <dt>Government:</dt>
                <dd>An elected council of upper class men rule Ishumen society. There are lower councils over different cities and states. Each council member has a different role, either for administration of goods, judgement of crimes, etc. </dd>
