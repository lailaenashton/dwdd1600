                <dt>Ruling God:</dt>
                <dd>Ura, God of the Air, the Wind, and the Nothingness that Makes Up Everything.</dd>
                <dt>People's Name:</dt>
                <dd>Urish People</dd>
                <dt>Average Life Span:</dt>
                <dd>40-45 years</dd>
                <dt>Age of Adulthood:</dt>
                <dd>5 years</dd>
                <dt>Gestation Period Length:</dt>
                <dd>2 months</dd>
                <dt>Average Adult Height:</dt>
                <dd>0.83 m</dd>
                <dt>Genders:</dt>
                <dd>The Urish species has 4 genders. Translated from their traditional language, there is boy and girl, then there is coyr and nog. She/her, he/him, che/cem, te/ter. Mom, dad, papa, and nini (respectively).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boy, He/him, Dad</li>
                        <li>Girl, She/her, Mom</li>
                        <li>Coyr, Che/cem, Papa</li>
                        <li>Nog, te/ter, Nini</li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
                <dt>Reproduction Process:</dt>
                <dd>When it is time for these creatures to mate, it requires 2-4 of them. They are innocent and childlike, and no intercourse is involved. They dig a pit in the sand until they reach low enough taht it fills with water. Reproduction always involves 1 girl. She lays a soft egg in the pool. Then a boy, coyr, and nog can all lay their gametes in the pool also. They egg will get fertilized with one gamete from each. The Urish species have 3 sets of DNA, 1 from mom, 1 from papa, 1/2 from dad, and 1/2 from nini. Once the egg is well fertilized, it froms a hard shell and accepts no more gametes. It takes 2 months for it to hatch. If there are no boys or nogs to mate, the egg can be fertilized twice boy a coyr. Basically, if the egg has to wait long enough, a biochemical reaction will allow it to accept a second coyr gamete. The gametes from the boy and nog contain 1/2 set of DNA. Some contain the top hald, some the bottom half. If an egg accepts a top half gamete, it will only accept a bottom half gamete from then on from a different parent. ENless there is no other half gamete producing person to give a half gamete. In that case, if the egg waits long enough, a different biochemical reacion will happen that allows it to accept the other half of the gamete from the same parent, either boy or nog. It doesn't matter if the top and bottom half come from the same parent or different ones, or, if in the case a coyr isn't present, if the last two gametes are made up of 2/2 or 1/3 combination of half gametes from the boy and nog.</dd>
                <dt>Gifts from Gods:</dt>
                <dd>All Urish people have minimal control over the air. It is enough power to help them use their glider wings to fly. When gifts are more cultivated and practiced, they can develop two additional basic spells. One creates a force field, the other is a spell to melt and mold sand into a glass fabric.</dd>
                <dt>Habitat:</dt>
                <dd>Urish people live on beaches and in low elevation places. They like to be where the atmosphere is thick and they can utilize the air better for their gliders. </dd>
                <dt>Physical Attriutes:</dt>
                <dd>Urish people are very small. In addition to being short, they are slender and have large heads for their bodies. They have light pinkish skin with freckles. Their hair is extremely curly. They have long pointed ears that are curled and twisted. They have four fingers and four toes. </dd>
                <dt>Life style and Culture:</dt>
                <dd>Urish people live in caravan groups all over Ithmanu, but primarily near the equator where it is warm. Each caravan travels or camps depending on the signs they read in nature and in the stars. The signs they look for are from the tablet of instructions given to them from their God, Ura. Interpretation of the tablet can vary from caravan to caravan. Sometimes, new caravans are made when the disputes on interpretation are not able to be resolved. More commonly, new caravans are made when one gets too large. Then they will break into two or three. The different caravans will often meet up for mating festivals or other ceremonies and festivals. The original tablet has been lost to the Urish people since the Aupthalans stole it. Yet each caravan has a book kept by their wisest of all the signs to look for. These books change over time as the wise ones add additional things or tweak what is already there. The Wise One in each caravan is the oldest. They are the only ones that can read and teach the other elders how to read also for when they pass on to the Great Nothingness that Makes Up Everything.</dd>
                <dt>Government:</dt>
                <dd>Each caravan is lead by the Wise One, the oldest of the group. They are always the head decision maker or leader, seeing as they are the wiseset and most lived.</dd>
