            <p>Ura, the god of the Nothingness that Makes Up Everything, was the first to notice the dying planet, Ithmanu. <a href="ura.html#ura">Ura</a> called cem's syblings to gather. <br>
            Down came <a href="auptha.html#auptha">Auptha</a>, Goddess of the Stars and their pull. <br>
            Down came <a href="onan.html#onan">Onan</a>, God of the Heat of the Heart.<br>
            Down came <a href="erith.html#erith">Erith</a>, God of the Flowing Water.<br>
            Down came <a href="ishu.html#ishu">Ishu</a>, God of the Rich Soil.<br>
            The gods took pity on Ithmanu. It was such a young planet and it was so sick. Onan acted first. They burrowed deep into the crust of Ithmanu, past layers and layers, until they reached the heart. The heart, the core of Ithmanu, was weak and dim. It was growing cold and close to death. Onan breathed the Heat of Life, the Heat of the Heart, into Ithmanu's core. Bright red flames enveloped the core and drove the sickness from it. The flames softened the heart and allowed it's life giving blood to flow like lava all the way to the edges of the crust. In the eruption of a volcano, Onan emerged and called on Erith to heal the now burning wounds on Ithmanu's skin.
            Erith appraised the textured and rough surface he had to work with. He glided down to the deepest most painful wounds and gently placed his hands down. The flowing water sprang from his hands, from his feet, from his body. It rushed and flowed into every wound, it filled every crack, it washed the face of Ithmanu. On the crest of a wave Erith emerged from the depths and called on Ishu to bring the rich soils.
            Ishu, from high above the surface, sowed his seed and scattered it on all the face of Ithmanu. His rich soils and many minerals and seeds sealed the healing of Onan and Erith. Ishu
