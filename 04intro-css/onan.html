                <dt>Ruling God:</dt>
                <dd>Onan, God of the Heat of the Heart</dd>
                <dt>People's Name:</dt>
                <dd>Onanians</dd>
                <dt>Average Life Span:</dt>
                <dd>100-110 years</dd>
                <dt>Age of Adulthood:</dt>
                <dd>30 years</dd>
                <dt>Gestation Period Length:</dt>
                <dd>3 weeks inside womb, 9 months outside womb in egg</dd>
                <dt>Average Adult Height:</dt>
                <dd>1.24 m</dd>
                <dt>Genders:</dt>
                <dd>Hermaphrodite</dd>
                <dt>Reproduction Process:</dt>
                <dd>Onanians cannot self fertilize, although they do produce both gametes necessary. It would produce an unviable embryo. When with a parter, either one or both of them can get fertilized at the same time. They lay eggs about 3-4 at a time. There is no rule about who stays home and who joins a workers guild. Many Onanians take turns being part of the Homemakers Guild with their partner. Often, members of the Homemakers Guild will work together to raise children in school and preschool settings. They hire teachers from the Teachers Guild to supplement children's education.</dd>
                <dt>Gifts from Gods:</dt>
                <dd>Onanians can perform fire and lava spells. Their ability to cultivate magic comes relatively easy to this species. They have this advantage, however, their spells are not as powerful as a result. Thus, they often incorporate their spells into things that last longer, like steels and metals and stones.</dd>
                <dt>Habitat:</dt>
                <dd>Onanians originally lived in the Volcanic Deserts of the South. They now live in tunnels and caves in the crust of Ithmanu, underground where no one else lives.</dd>
                <dt>Physical Attriutes:</dt>
                <dd>Onanians would look like reptilian kangaroos mixed with a human to people from Earth. They do not have pouches. They have large powerful tails to help keep their balance, their large powerful hind legs are perfect for running long distances, not for jumping. Their skins look like cracked desert lands, in shades of white, reds, and black. They have big eyes and large floppy ears that can be hugged in close to the skull for protection.</dd>
                <dt>Life style and Culture:</dt>
                <dd>At the time that the Onanian people originally when into hiding, they primarly inhabited one area underground. Their numbers had been reduced by war with the Aupthalans. They lived in fear. So, they left their cities of the desert and dug directly below them to live. Onanians are perhaps the closest to understanding creation. Their move to live below the surface world in many ways connected and intertwined them even more with the raw powers of Onan. Onan created the layers of rock and stone into Ithmanu. THey were the one that blew the heat of life into Ithmanu's core. It was the move under ground that made Onan most proud of their children. There, the Onanians learned so much more about how to use their powers and how to draw on the power of their god. They also learned out to look to their minerals for guidance. They can use their lava magic to heat stones and see things in them. Onanians that specialize in this magic are called Seers. They brought the desert animal herds and the crops that they could with them underground. The colors of their dwellings and of their clothes very much reflect the desert still as there aren't many reasons to change it (no predators, enemies ore fashion influence from other peoples). However, in their mining, they have discovered many twisting and turning caves and wild underground creatures never before known.</dd>
                <dt>Government:</dt>
                <dd>The Onanian government is fairly simple. There is no need for a large government when there are no enemies and there is abundant food. A representative from each guild is selected for the High Council. The guilds are Miners, Seers, Metal workers, Homemakers, Farmers, Teachers, etc. They make laws decisions based on voting within the council.</dd>
